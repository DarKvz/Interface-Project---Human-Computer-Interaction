# Interface Project - Human-Computer Interaction

## Introduction
This repository contains the screens developed for an academic project in the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** course. The goal of this work is to apply user-centered design principles to create intuitive, accessible, and functional interfaces.

## Project Objectives
- Design an intuitive interface for an online shopping system.
- Implement usability and accessibility principles.
- Simulate the user experience with well-structured screens.
- Use prototyping tools like **Figma**.

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **Figma**: For interface prototyping.
- **Adobe XD** (as an alternative if needed).
- **Core UX/UI principles**, such as:
  - Nielsen's heuristics.
  - Responsive design.
  - Proper contrast for accessibility.

## Screen Structure

### 1. **Login Screen**
   - Fields for email and password.
   - Option to log in via Facebook.
   - Error message for invalid credentials.

### 2. **Product Selection Prototype**
   - A prototype model for selecting food and products within the app.
   - Product images included.
   - Display of the store name and prices where the product will be selected.

### 3. **User Profile Screen**
   - Basic user information.
   - Recent orders list.
   
### 4. **Store Location Map Screen**
   - Displays nearby stores on an interactive map.
   - Store search option.
   - Shows the nearest markets and delivery personnel based on the userâ€™s location.

### 5. **Order Summary Screen**
   - List of selected items for purchase.
   - Estimated delivery time.
   - Option to confirm the order.
   - Payment processing and location confirmation.

### 6. **User Personas Screens**
   - Fictional user profiles based on target audience research.
   - Information about age, profession, goals, and tech skills.

## How to View the Project
1. Open the shared **Figma** file.
2. Navigate through the screens using the presentation mode.
3. Export the screens to other formats (PNG, PDF) if needed.
4. Check the **prototipo.pptx** file for more details on the high-fidelity prototype.

## Final Considerations
This project was developed based on best practices in interface design and user experience, ensuring smooth and intuitive navigation. Any feedback or suggestions for improvement are welcome!
